## Cloud Uploader (Google Drive & Rclone)

This bot now integrates advanced upload functionalities, allowing you to send downloaded music directly to Google Drive or any Rclone-compatible cloud storage.

### How to Use the New Uploader

The new features are managed through a simple, interactive menu.

1.  **Access the Settings:**
    *   Start by sending the `/uploadersettings` or `/usettings` command to the bot.
    *   This will open the new "Uploader Settings" panel.

2.  **Configure Your Upload Destination:**
    *   **Set Default Uploader:** In the settings panel, you will see a button to "Set Default Uploader". You can choose between `Telegram`, `Google Drive`, and `Rclone`. This choice is saved on a per-user basis.
    *   **Configure Google Drive:** Click "GDrive Settings", and the bot will ask you to upload your `token.pickle` file. This file authorizes the bot to upload to your Google Drive. You can create it using the `generate_drive_token.py` script.
    *   **Configure Rclone:** Click "Rclone Settings", and the bot will ask you to upload your `rclone.conf` file, which contains your Rclone remote configurations.

3.  **Download as Usual:**
    *   Once you have configured your preferred uploader, simply use the `/download` command as you normally would.
    *   The bot will automatically check your setting and upload the downloaded files to your chosen destination.

### Technical Implementation & Advanced Features

*   **Modular Uploader:** The uploader system in `bot/helpers/uploader.py` has been refactored to use a central `upload_item` router function. This function directs the upload to the correct backend (Telegram, GDrive, or Rclone).
*   **Database Integration:** The database schema has been updated to store user-specific configuration files (`rclone.conf` and `token.pickle`) as binary data. This works for both **PostgreSQL and MongoDB**.
*   **Service Accounts (GDrive):** The integration includes support for Google Drive Service Accounts. To use them:
    1.  Generate the service account `.json` files using the `gen_sa_accounts.py` script.
    2.  Place the generated `accounts` folder in the root directory of the bot.
    3.  Set the `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS=True` variable in your `.env` file.
*   **Multi-Drive Support (GDrive):** The GDrive search and list features support searching across multiple drives. Use the `driveid.py` script to create a `list_drives.txt` file to configure this.
*   **Helper Scripts:** The root directory now contains `generate_drive_token.py`, `gen_sa_accounts.py`, `add_to_team_drive.py`, and `driveid.py` to help you manage your Google Drive credentials and configurations. You may need to install their specific dependencies from `requirements-cli.txt` to run them (`pip install -r requirements-cli.txt`).

## Tidal NG Downloader (Beta)

This bot features a modern, robust backend for handling Tidal downloads, referred to as "Tidal NG" (Next Generation). It operates by interfacing with a powerful external command-line tool, `tidal-dl-ng`.

### How It Works

Unlike the legacy provider which used a Python library directly, the Tidal NG handler acts as a smart controller for the `tidal-dl-ng` CLI tool. When you request a Tidal download:
1.  The bot determines the correct, isolated directory for the current download task.
2.  It programmatically modifies the `tidal-dl-ng` tool's own `settings.json` file to set the `download_base_path` and any user-specific settings.
3.  It executes the CLI tool (`python cli.py dl <URL>`), which then downloads the music to the location specified by the bot.
4.  After the download is complete or fails, the bot restores the `settings.json` file to its original state to ensure system integrity.

**Note on First Use**: The configuration directory (`/root/.config/tidal_dl_ng/`) and `settings.json` file for the tool are created automatically the first time you use any Tidal NG feature. No manual setup is required.

### Configuration & Settings

Configuration for the Tidal NG provider is now handled via direct commands, which gives you full, real-time control over the `settings.json` file. This is the same robust method used for the Apple Music provider.

-   **Accessing Settings**: Navigate to `/settings` -> `Provider Settings` -> `Tidal NG`.
-   This menu provides important action buttons and explains how to use the new command-based system.

-   **Utility Buttons**:
    -   `🔑 Login` / `🚨 Logout`: Manage your `tidal-dl-ng` session.
    -   `📂 Import Config File`: For advanced users, this allows you to upload configuration files (e.g., `token.json`) directly into the Tidal NG configuration directory.
    -   `⚙️ Execute cfg`: Displays the tool's current configuration or generates a new default one if it's missing. This is useful for seeing all available keys.

-   **New Commands for Real-time Control**:
    -   `/tidal_ng_config` or `/tncfg`: Shows help and a list of example keys.
    -   `/tidal_ng_get <key>`: Shows the current value of a specific key in `settings.json`.
    -   `/tidal_ng_set <key> <value>`: Sets a key to a specific value. The bot will validate the input for known keys.
    -   `/tidal_ng_toggle <key>`: Toggles a boolean key between `true` and `false`.
    -   `/tidal_ng_show [keys...]`: Shows the entire `settings.json` file, or just the specified keys.

This new system replaces the old, non-functional UI buttons and gives you complete control. As a result, the bot no longer uses any per-user settings from its own database for Tidal NG downloads; it relies entirely on the `settings.json` file that you manage with these commands.

### Important Notes
- **FFmpeg Path**: The bot will always forcefully set the `path_binary_ffmpeg` to `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` before every download to ensure video processing and FLAC extraction works reliably. You do not need to set this key yourself.
- **Download Path**: The bot will always set the `download_base_path` to a temporary, per-task directory to ensure downloads do not conflict. The `TIDAL_NG_DOWNLOAD_PATH` environment variable can still be used to override this.
    - New: You can now override the Tidal NG `download_base_path` via environment: `TIDAL_NG_DOWNLOAD_BASE_PATH`. This takes precedence over `settings.json` (legacy `TIDAL_NG_DOWNLOAD_PATH` also supported).
    - New: A top-of-panel toggle, “Preset Buttons: ON/OFF”, lets you temporarily hide the cycling/toggle preset buttons to avoid accidental changes. Interactive JSON commands (`/tidal_ng_*`) remain available.

## Apple Wrapper Controls (Apple Music)

- **Location**: `Settings -> Providers -> Apple Music`
- **Buttons**:
  - `🧩 Setup Wrapper`: Starts an interactive setup that asks for your Apple ID username and password, then runs the wrapper setup script with those credentials. If 2FA is required, the bot will detect it and prompt you to send the 2FA code, then continues automatically.
  - `⏹️ Stop Wrapper`: Stops any running wrapper process. Includes a confirmation step to prevent accidental taps.

### How Setup Works
1. Tap `🧩 Setup Wrapper`.
2. Send your Apple ID username when asked.
3. Send your Apple ID password when asked.
4. The bot runs the setup script with `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` exported in the environment, equivalent to:
   ```bash
   USERNAME="your_username" PASSWORD="your_password" /usr/src/app/downloader/setup_wrapper.sh
   ```
5. If the wrapper requests 2FA, you will see a prompt. Send the 2FA code as a normal message within 3 minutes.
6. On success, you'll get a confirmation. On failure, the last part of the script output is shown for debugging.

### How Stop Works
- Tap `⏹️ Stop Wrapper` -> Confirm. The bot runs:
  ```bash
  /usr/src/app/downloader/stop_wrapper.sh
  ```
- It kills wrapper processes and frees ports 10020/20020.

### Configuration
- Override script paths with env vars if needed:
  - `APPLE_WRAPPER_SETUP_PATH` (default `/usr/src/app/downloader/setup_wrapper.sh`)
  - `APPLE_WRAPPER_STOP_PATH` (default `/usr/src/app/downloader/stop_wrapper.sh`)

### Notes & Security
- Credentials are only used to start the setup process and are not stored by the bot.
- You can cancel the flow any time by sending `/cancel`.
- If 2FA prompt does not appear (rare), setup continues and completes automatically.

## Apple Music Controls (enhanced)

The Apple provider now has its own zip controls and a rich settings panel driven by `config.yaml` (as used by `zhaarey/apple-music-downloader`).

- Apple-specific zip toggles (independent from core):
  - Zip Albums (Apple)
  - Zip Playlists (Apple)

- Config panel buttons (mutate `APPLE_CONFIG_YAML_PATH`):
  - Cover: size (1000/3000/5000), format (jpg/png/original), embed cover, save artist cover
  - Lyrics: type (lyrics/syllable-lyrics), format (lrc/ttml), embed lyrics, save lyrics file
  - Animated artwork: save animated artwork, emby animated artwork
  - Music video: MV audio type (atmos/ac3/aac), MV max (1080/1440/2160)
  - Playlist helpers: download album cover for playlist, use songinfo for playlist
  - Concurrency: `limit-max` (cycle common values)
  - Naming: album folder format presets, playlist folder format presets, song file format presets

Commands `/config_get`, `/config_set`, `/config_toggle`, `/config_show` still work and write to `config.yaml` safely with backups.

### Flags Popup for Apple /download

- Enable in Settings → Providers → Apple Music → “Flags Popup”.
- When ON, sending `/download <apple_url>` opens a quick picker to avoid typing flags:
  - Single track: applies `--song`
  - Atmos album: applies `--atmos`
  - Atmos track: applies `--song --atmos`
- The popup closes after selection or cancel. When OFF, manual flags still work (e.g., `/download --song <url>`).

### Guard against accidental touches

- A top-of-panel toggle, “Preset Buttons: ON/OFF”, hides the cycling/toggle preset buttons in the Apple panel to prevent accidental config edits. The interactive editor remains available.

### File Management

The Apple Music panel also includes tools for managing the downloader's internal files located in the `/root/amalac/` directory.

-   **`📂 Manage Files`**: Opens an interactive, button-based file browser for the `/root/amalac/` directory.
    -   Navigate into sub-folders.
    -   Select a file to get options to **Download** it to your chat or **Delete** it from the server (with confirmation).
    -   Use the "Up" and "Back" buttons to navigate the file system.

-   **`📂 Import File`**: Allows you to upload a file directly to the `/root/amalac/` directory.
    -   After tapping the button, the bot will ask you to send a document.
    -   The uploaded file will be saved in `/root/amalac`.
    -   If a file with the same name already exists, it will be automatically overwritten.

## Commands and Usage

These commands work in any chat where the bot is present. Copy-paste directly into Telegram.

- /start: Show welcome message
- /help: Show available commands
- /settings: Open settings panel (Provider panels include Tidal NG JSON and Apple YAML configurators)
- /download <url> [--options]: Start a download for a supported provider
This build is Apple Music–only. Qobuz, Tidal, and Deezer integrations have been removed. Use Apple Music links like `https://music.apple.com/...`.
  - Examples:
    - ```
/download https://music.apple.com/…
    ```
    - ```
/download --alac-max 192000 https://music.apple.com/…
    ```
    - Reply to a message containing the link and send:
      ```
/download --atmos
      ```
  - On start, the bot replies with a Task ID. Use it to manage the task.
- Queue Mode (sequential downloads/uploads):
  - Turn on: Settings → Core → Queue Mode: ON
  - While ON, /download does not start immediately; it enqueues and replies with a Queue ID and position.
  - See your queue: use /qqueue (alias /queue) or Settings → Core → Open Queue Panel
  - Cancel a queued link: /qcancel <queue_id> or use the ❌ button in Queue Panel
  - Cancel the currently running job: /cancel <task_id>
- /cancel <task_id>: Cancel a specific running task by its ID
  - Example:
    ```
/cancel ab12cd34
    ```
- /cancel_all: Cancel all your running tasks (download, zipping, uploading)
  - Example:
    ```
/cancel_all
    ```
- /clone <gdrive_link>: Copy a file or folder within Google Drive.
- /count <gdrive_link>: Count the files and folders in a Google Drive path.

### Core Settings Panel

The main settings panel (`/settings`) contains several core toggles that affect the bot's general behavior.

-   **`Safe Zip Names`**: Controls how zip file names are created for all providers.
    -   **ON (Default):** Replaces spaces in album/playlist titles with underscores (`_`) for better compatibility. E.g., `My Album` -> `My_Album.zip`.
    -   **OFF:** Keeps original spaces in the filename. E.g., `My Album.zip`.

### What happens on cancel
- The bot stops the active step (downloading, zipping, uploading)
- Any partial files/archives are cleaned up automatically
- The progress message is updated to indicate cancellation

### Realtime system usage in progress
- Progress messages now include CPU, RAM, and Disk usage to help monitor server load while tasks run.

## Apple Music Config (config.yaml) via Telegram

Admins can view and edit `/root/amalac/config.yaml` in real time. Changes are written safely with a backup created each time.
